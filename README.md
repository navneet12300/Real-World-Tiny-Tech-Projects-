# Real-World-Tiny-Tech-Projects-
This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects created to explore different technologies.   Each project is simple by design â€” focused on learning core concepts and real-world setups . Think of it as a **playground of experiments**: from backend to AI, real-time systems to system design, and beyond.   Tiny projects. Big learning.
