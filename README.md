# Real-World-Tiny-Tech-Projects-
This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects created to explore different technologies.   Each project is simple by design — focused on learning core concepts and real-world setups . Think of it as a **playground of experiments**: from backend to AI, real-time systems to system design, and beyond.   Tiny projects. Big learning.  

# Backend Playground 🏗️

A collection of **small, real-world inspired backend projects** built with Node.js (and sometimes React on the frontend).  
Each project is designed to explore a new concept or technology in a **practical, hands-on way**.

## 🎯 Goal of This Repo

This is not about giant production-ready apps.  
It’s about building **tiny, functional projects** that help you understand:  

- Real-world **backend setups** (APIs, sockets, notifications, storage, auth, etc.)  
- **System design principles** in action (scaling, fault tolerance, architecture).  
- How backend concepts connect to the **frontend experience**.

## 📖 Extended Learning

I’m also writing **articles for each project** where I break down the “why” and “how” in a conversational way.  

- 📄 Medium Articles → [MEDIUM](https://medium.com/@udaaansocial)  
- 💻 GitHub Repo → You’re already here 😉
